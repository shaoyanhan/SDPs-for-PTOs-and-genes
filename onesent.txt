28414264	ICE1	cold tolerance	Overexpression of OsICE1 and OsICE2 in Arabidopsis significantly enhanced the cold tolerance of Arabidopsis seedlings and improved the expression of cold-response genes.
28414264	ICE1	cold tolerance	Furthermore, we showed that both OsICE1 and OsICE2 physically interact with OsMYBS3, a single DNA-binding repeat MYB transcription factor that is essential for cold adaptation in rice, suggesting that OsICE1/OsICE2 and OsMYBS3 probably act through specific signal transduction mechanisms to coordinate cold tolerance in rice.

9278162	PPDK	PPDK	To investigate the molecular changes that might have occurred in genes for pyruvate,orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK) during the evolution of C4 plants from C3 plants, we isolated a full-length cDNA and the corresponding gene for a C4-like PPDK from rice, a C3 gramineous plant and compared their structures and promoter activities to those of the corresponding gene from maize, a C4 gramineous plant.
9278162	PPDK	PPDK	The deduced amino acid sequence of the rice PPDK was 88% homologous to the maize C4-type PPDK in the mature peptide region and 56% homologous in the transit peptide region.
